## Feasibility Studies
In order to develop the autonomous referee different technologies have been taken into consideration to create the Data to be implemented in the decision algorithm as follow:
- Improve 2021 MSD work(Using Tech United Data in Real-time)
- Using Drone
- Sensors Mounted on top of each robot
- Using Data Fusion for data collection
- Using Stadium Cameras

For each of the above technology a feasibility study report has been prepared which can be found in: docs/[FeasibilityAnalysis](github address")

<!-- System Architecture -->
## System Architecture

The **Architecture Description** document can be found in the following folder: docs/[Architecture](github address)
 
<!-- Implementation -->
## Implementation and Validation

The developed python code  can be found in the following folder in GitHub repository: AutonomousReferee/[src](https://github.com/Anup8777/AutonomousReferee/tree/main/src "src")
 
2022 MSD AutoRef can be used to detect the violation .....................

<!-- How to get a smooth start -->
## How to get a smooth start?

- It is recommended to not start from the scratch.
- It is highly recommended to get in touch with the Tech United team and use the Tech United repository in case of using TURTLEs. <br />
  Some of the people that you can get in touch with:<br />
  Tech United Website: https://www.techunited.nl/en/<br />
  Tech United (Techunited@tue.nl)<br />
  René van de Molengraft - Project Sponsor and Technical Consultant (M.J.G.v.d.Molengraft@tue.nl)<br />
  Ruben Beumer (r.m.beumer@tue.nl) <br />
- In the Tech United repository there are tools that may be useful for the development of the AutoRef system.<br />
   **1. Greenfield**<br />
   This is the tool, emulator, inside the Tech United reposoitory which can collect the real time data from soccer robots during the match and save the data in a \*.mat   file. <br />

   **2. Simulator**<br />
   This is a tool inside the Tech United repository which can be used to simulate the soccer matches. Different scenarios of a soccer match can be simulated by this tool which can be helpful for the design of the AutoRef system.<br />

   **3. Refbox**<br />
   It is the tool that human referee use to send commands to TURTLEs during the match.<br />

- Ask for permission for using the surveillance cameras at the Robotics Lab.
  You may contact Ömür Arslan (o.arslan@tue.nl) to ask for the permission.
- Get in touch with MSD2022.
- Get in touch with Matthias Briegel<br />
  Matthias is the person who has previously worked on developing AutoRef system and he may share some interesting ideas for the development of the AutoRef system. (matthias_briegel@hotmail.com)
